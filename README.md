1. Rename the StarterBook.xlsx file you have been working with in this module: Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx.

2. Create a folder called “resources” to hold the PNGs of the two charts you will create.

3. In the Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx workbook, create a new column labeled "Years."

4. In the "Years" column, use the YEAR() function to extract the year from the “Date Created Conversion” column.
	If you’d like a hint on how to use the YEAR() function, that’s totally okay. If not, that’s great too. 
	You can always revisit this later if you change your mind.
